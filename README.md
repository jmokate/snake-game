# Retro Snake Game

### Building this old school game has been a fun and challenging experience in building up my skills with Javascript. As an assignement from my mentorship program, this project trained me to flex a new muscle when it comes to working animation with the HTML Canvas in JS.

#### This project was built using:

## HTML 5 & Javascript ES6.
